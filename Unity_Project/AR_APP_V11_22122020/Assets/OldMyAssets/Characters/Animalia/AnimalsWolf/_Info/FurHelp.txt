We provide the following assets that can be used with most of the fur solutions based on shells:
* Wolf_Grow - skeletal mesh used for shells
* Wolf_FurGuides - fur splines that guide the shell growth/length
* Wolf_FurTip - texture for the tip of the fur strands/shells
* Wolf_FurMasks
		* Red channel - interpolate between different fur strand thickness (e.g. thin on legs, head, thick on top of the head), you need to modify your shaders to use this mask
		* Green channel - masks out the parts without fur
